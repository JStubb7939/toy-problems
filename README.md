# toy-problems
This is, quite evidently, a repository of toy problems, complete with tests for each one. Feel free to fork and use for your own toy problem repo! It comes stock with mocha and chai for assertions. I may add more if the need arises. I did not include a script to run all of the tests, nor did I create a test directory because that seems silly to me. I do one toy problem at a time.

# Installation
Run `npm install` for mocha/chai dependencies.

# Recommended Use
Inside the problems directory, create individual directories for each toy problem. Within the individual directory, create two js files -- one for the toy problem and one for the test. When ready to run the test, run `mocha /path/to/testfile`.
